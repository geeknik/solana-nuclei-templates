info:
  name: Solana Missing Account Owner Check
  author: geeknik
  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects when a Solana program fails to verify the owner of an account before reading or modifying it. Without proper ownership checks, a malicious account created by an attacker could be passed in, potentially leading to security breaches.
  remediation: |
    Always verify account ownership before reading or modifying account data: `if account.owner != &expected_program_id { return Err(ProgramError::IllegalOwner); }`
