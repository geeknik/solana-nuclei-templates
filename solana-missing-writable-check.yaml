  name: Solana Missing Writable Account Check
  author: geeknik
  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects when a Solana smart contract modifies account data without verifying the account is marked as writable, which can lead to failed transactions in production.
  remediation: |
    Always verify account writability using `if !account.is_writable { return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData); }` before modifying account data.
