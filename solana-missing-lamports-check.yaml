  name: Solana Missing Lamports Check
  author: geeknik
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects when a program reads from account data without checking if the account has any lamports, which can lead to reading from deleted accounts.
  remediation: |
    Before reading account data, verify the account has lamports: `if **account.try_borrow_lamports()? > 0 { /* safe to read data */ }`
